Manage ciao's oplink customers


This app uses a rails framework and communicates with oplink database servers as to perform activationn and deactivation requests!
We also build api to provide a tunnel for csn integration.

How the API works for csn:
==========================
Add Customer Method
********************************************************************************************************************************************
* post request using the url of the following format
* http://oplink.ciaocrm.com/csnCustomers/addCustomer?token=TOKEN&phone=PHONE&first=FIRST&last=LAST&country=AFRICA&email=EMAIL
* token is the authorization header we will provide you
* first, last, phone and email are valid customer information
* The possible API responses are: Customer was successfully created,
  Error related with wrong/missing customer information or duplicate email,
  Error due to invalid TOKEN, Error due to wrong format of the request!
* For a successful creation we provide a user id. Please use it to make a payment in the future.
********************************************************************************************************************************************

Add Opu Method
********************************************************************************************************************************************
* post request using the url of the following format
* http://oplink.ciaocrm.com/csnCustomers/addOpu?token=TOKEN&first=FIRST&last=LAST&sn=SERIALNO
* token is the authorization header we will provide you
* first, last are valid customer information
* serial number can be found on the back of the OPU box
* The possible API responses are: Opu for customer was successfully created,
  Error related with wrong/missing opu information or duplicate serial number,
  Error due to invalid TOKEN, Error due to wrong format of the request!
********************************************************************************************************************************************

Add Payment Method
********************************************************************************************************************************************
* post request using the url of the following format
* http://oplink.ciaocrm.com/csnCustomers/addPayment?user_id=ID&token=TOKEN&amount=0.0&sn=SN
* user_id is what you received when the customer was created
* token is the authorization header
* amount is how much you are adding a opu
* sn is that opu's number
* The possible API responses are: Payment successful for customer, Couldn't find customer or OPU
  Error related with wrong opu or customer information or missing amount,
  Error due to invalid TOKEN, Error due to wrong format of the request!

High level overview
=====================
When a customer comes up to us and wants to buy the product and start with 1 opu.
There are 3 steps we need to take:
1. Create that customer in our database.
2. Add an OPU
3. Add payment to that opu. This will automatically activate the opu and the customer which this opu belongs to.
   It will also set expiration date a month from the activation date. Lastly it will send an email notification to the admin users.
4. TODO (adding fields for each of the devices)
*Of course there will be a need to add/modify/delete/opus and other devices
*For now we treat the devices as part of the package belonging to a customer.


Some tools I used
==================
Rufus scheduler to deactivate the opu device upon expiration date and send notificatons
Created Json API to communicate with csn to add customers
Used Savon Client to communicate with oplink API to send activation/deactivation requests and get info about a particular device
Twitter bootsrap for the views with some customizations
Devise for authentication with signup limited to only admins

A word about the css, nivo slider
=================================
Be sure to add this line in application.rb and set assets.compile to true in production.rb
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += ['locales/*.css.scss']
Besides the other configuration details gemfile, application.css and application.js this will
allow for the compilation to be when you load the application.
*If you run into trouble run rake tmp:cache:clear and rake assets:clean to clear out the preloaded css.
